There have been a lot of things about the way Evusheld has been introduced that have led to doctors not offering it to some people who need it. It was shipped out in a hurry, and not well-publicized. And Evusheld was not shipped directly to doctors &mdash; your doctor does not have any at the office. Some doctors do not know a lot about exactly who qualifies for Evusheld and how much is available. Some doctors are so busy they have not had time to contact all the patients they have who qualify for Evusheld. So we recommend that you do your best to figure out on your own whether you qualify, then contact your doctor if you think you do. If your doctor has told you in the past that you are unusually likely to get infections, that probably means &nbsp;that the doctor thinks you are immunocompromised. If the doctor has not said that, we recommend that you look read what follows to try to get an idea whether you are. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">You </span><span class="c3 c16">could </span><span class="c9 c3">try just skipping the research and asking your doctor whether you are immunocompromised and need Evusheld. However, we have heard a lot of stories from people who did that and were told by their doctor that they did not qualify or that there was no Evusheld available. So we think it is better to be prepared in advance with information about why you may qualify, and how much Evusheld is available near you, so that when you talk to your doctor you are well prepared.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c18 c3"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c24 c43 c5 c27">How do I know whether I am immunocompromised enough to need Evusheld?</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c24 c3 c5">The truth is, there is a lot of uncertainty among doctors regarding this exact question. &nbsp;Some are not clear about the guidelines the CDC (Center for Disease Control) have given regarding Evusheld. &nbsp;Others are, but see that there are a lot</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c24 c3 c5">of judgment calls to be made regarding who, exactly, qualifies for Evusheld. &nbsp;If a doctor has told you you do not qualify for Evusheld they may or may not be right. &nbsp;Then again, they may be uninformed about the guidelines, or informed but just making a different judgment call than another doctor would. &nbsp;In this section we are going to fill you in as well as we can about the guidelines and some of the judgment calls involved. &nbsp;Unless you already know for sure that you are quite immunocompromised and qualify for Evusheld, you should look at them.

And some people with auto-immune diseases do better if they take a drug to damp down their immune system. Auto-immune diseases are diseases where the body attacks some of its own cells the way it would attack enemies like viruses and bacteria.

If your degree of immunocompromise is not severe, you </span><span class="c3 c30 c42">[may be adequately protected](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(21)00593-3/fulltext) </span><span class="c3 c5 c42">just by getting an extra vaccination on top of the usual series, although for that too you need to qualify. &nbsp;Here are the government [recommendations for vaccination schedules](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html#mod) for the moderately and severely immunocompromised.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c24 c3 c42 c53"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c3 c5 c42">&nbsp;But bear in mind that the summary we just gave is actually much more conservative than the CDC guidelines. &nbsp;According to the CDC guidelines regarding drugs, people taking any of the drugs on Table 4 qualify for Evusheld. &nbsp;So if you would like to err on the side of caution and get Evusheld, even though the immune suppressants you are taking are not B cell-depleting drugs, it certainly appears that you qualify. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s our impression from talking to doctors that some might turn you down for Evusheld even though you are taking certain of the &nbsp;immune suppressants. &nbsp;They might, for example, say you are taking too small a dose of the drug to be very immune suppressed, or that you have not been taking it long enough. &nbsp;They might recommend that you simply stop taking the immune-suppressing drug for 2 weeks before getting vaccinated, and not resume it until your body has had time to respond to the vaccine by building immunity. &nbsp;(And that, in fact, is a perfectly valid strategy, if it is safe for you to just discontinue your immune-suppressing drug for that period.) We think, though, that doctors are much less likely to turn you down if you are taking </span><span class="c0 c5">Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors, </span><span class="c24 c3 c5 c42">B cell-depleting drug, or a steroids at the doses given in the table. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c24 c3 c5 c42"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c43 c27">Is there a shortage of Evusheld?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c3">A lot of people are immuno</span><span class="c3">compromis</span><span class="c9 c3">ed</span><span class="c3">. </span><span class="c9 c3">Of course, some might not want to get the Evusheld shot</span><span class="c3">. </span><span class="c9 c3">If we use a conservative estimate of how many immuno</span><span class="c3">compromis</span><span class="c9 c3">ed people there are, and aim to protect half of them with Evusheld, we would need 4 million doses of the drug</span><span class="c3">. </span><span class="c9 c3">&nbsp;The US government has about </span><span class="c3">875</span><span class="c9 c3">,000 doses of Evusheld from the manufacture</span><span class="c3">r.
